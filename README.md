## 1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cmusmashlab/SAMoSA.git
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment
We recommend using conda. Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04`, with `python 3.8`.

```
conda create -n "samosa" python=3.8.3
conda activate samosa
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=10.2 cudnn=7.6

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Download the SAMoSA dataset
Download the `Data` folder from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kmv4y3mu7fx8oyp/AAAv1BmCAub00Alp-xPdlA5sa?dl=0) (2.88 GB) and place in `SAMoSA/Data`. 
```bash
Data/
└── TrainingDataset
```

Each file in the `TrainingDataset` folder contains synchronized Audio and IMU data.  
The file name contains all the information regarding the contents of the file.  

For example:  
`49---Kitchen---Chopping---1.pkl`  

Participant ID: 49, Context: Kitchen, Activity: Chopping, TrialNo: 1

Each pickle file has an `Audio` and `IMU` key. Speech (Other) activity files contain an additional `1kHz_Audio` key. 
- `Audio` contains a 1D array of audio data, sampled at 16kHz. We release data for all activities excluding speech at 16kHz. Speech is released at 1kHz (.
- `IMU` is a 2D array of (N\_Samples, 9 axes) sampled at ~50Hz.
- `1kHz_Audio` is a 1D array of audio data, subsampled to 1kHz. Whenever this key is present, the `Audio` key contains an array of zeros with the same shape as the original 16kHz array.  
- Refer to [this notebook](Code/0.%20Dataset%20Intro.ipynb) and the paper for more information.

## 4. Download the SAMoSA models
Download the `Models` folder from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ly2k47llynd4bl2/AACIqr9BCzmxsBbwS0xVML59a?dl=0) (2.46 GB) and place in `SAMoSA/Models`. It should have the following tree structure. Note, to replicate results from the paper, you must download all 20 models from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hc302qcid5nnkes/AADtsM5KeNTDrEX5TjLwA54oa?dl=0) (49.5 GB).
```bash
Models/
├── Motion
│   └── 17.h5
├── MotionSound
│   ├── 1000
│   │   └── 17
│   │       ├── 17.h5
│   │       ├── lb.pkl
│   │       └── norm_params.pkl
│   └── 16000
│       └── 17
│           ├── 17.h5
│           ├── lb.pkl
│           └── norm_params.pkl
└── Sound
    ├── 1000
    │   └── 17.h5
    └── 16000
        └── 17.h5
```

## 5. Generate Predictions
Run scripts in `Code/1. Generate Predictions`. This will generate predictions in a new folder located at `SAMoSA/Preds`, with the following structure.
```bash
Preds/
├── Motion
├── MotionSound
│   ├── 1000
│   └── 16000
└── Sound
    ├── 1000
    └── 16000
```

## 6. Run Evaluation notebooks 
Note, results from the paper are averaged across all 20 Leave-One-Participant-Out (LOPO) cross validation folds.
- [Evaluation notebook for context wise metrics](Code/3.%20Evaluate/1.%20Context%20Wise%20results.ipynb)
- [Evaluation notebook for frame wise metrics](Code/3.%20Evaluate/2.%20Frame%20Wise%20metrics.ipynb)

## Annotator Web App
The annotator app that we used during data collection can be found [here](https://github.com/VimalMollyn/UserStudyAnnotator).

## Android WearOS App for data collection and streaming
Download the Sensor Streamer app [here](https://github.com/VimalMollyn/SensorStreamerWearOS)!

## Coming Soon!
- Real-Time demos and visualizations
